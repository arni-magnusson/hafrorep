In 2014, landings of saithe ({\i Pollachius virens}) were 46\,000 t, compared to
58\,000 t in 2013. The TAC for the quota year 2014/2015 was set according to the
harvest control rule (HCR) at 58\,000 t.

The catch weights have have decreased for ages 4--6 in recent years but are
close to average for other ages. Biomass indices from the spring trawl survey
were high in \mbox{2012--2013} but lower in 2014--2015. The reference biomass of
age~4 and older is estimated as 255\,000~t at the beginning of 2014, with a
harvest rate of 18\% in 2014. The 2008 and 2009 year classes are large but
recruitment has been lower since then. Short-term projections based on the HCR
indicate that the reference biomass at the beginning of 2016 will be around
238\,000 t.

According to the HCR, the saithe TAC for the quota year 2015/2016 will be
55\,000 t.
